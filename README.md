# Creating an Assistant with GPT and Custom Functions

## Introduction

Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook! In this project, we will guide you through the process of creating an intelligent
assistant using the GPT architecture. Leveraging the power of GPT, our assistant will be capable of understanding and
generating human-like text, making it a versatile tool for various applications.

### Objectives

1. **Understand GPT Architecture:** Gain insights into the working principles of GPT (Generative Pre-trained
   Transformer) and how it processes natural language.
2. **Setup and Initialization:** Learn how to set up the necessary environment and initialize the GPT model.
3. **Creating Custom Functions:** Develop custom functions to extend the assistant's capabilities, making it more
   interactive and functional.
4. **Integration and Testing:** Integrate the functions with the GPT model and test the assistant to ensure it performs
   as expected.

### What You Will Learn

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Basic concepts and the significance of embeddings in understanding text.
- **Model Initialization:** How to load and initialize a pre-trained GPT model.
- **Function Creation:** Techniques to write custom functions that enhance the assistant's functionality.
- **Practical Applications:** Real-world examples and use cases where such an assistant can be beneficial.

### Prerequisites

- **Basic Python Knowledge:** Familiarity with Python programming is essential.
- **Understanding of NLP:** A basic understanding of Natural Language Processing will be helpful.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Basic knowledge of navigating and executing code in Jupyter Notebook.

### Tools and Libraries

- **OpenAI's GPT:** We will use OpenAI's GPT model as the core of our assistant.
- **Python Libraries:** Essential libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `requests` for various functionalities.

By the end of this notebook, you will have a functional assistant powered by GPT, enhanced with custom functions
tailored to specific needs. Let's dive in and start building our intelligent assistant!
